WHAT IS PHISHING AND HOW DOES IT WORK?:


WHAT IS PHISHING?
Phishing is a type of cyber attack where attackers use fake emails, messages, or websites to trick victims into revealing sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, or personal data.


HOW DOES PHISHING WORK?
Phishing attacks typically involve the following steps:


1. RESEARCH: Attackers research their targets to gather information about their interests, habits, and contacts.
2. BAIT: Attackers create a convincing message or email that appears to come from a legitimate source, such as a bank or a popular online service.
3. HOOK: The message or email contains a link, attachment, or prompt that encourages the victim to take action, such as clicking on a link, downloading a file, or providing login credentials.
4. EXPLOIT: If the victim takes the bait, the attacker can gain access to their sensitive information, install malware, or take control of their device.


TYPES OF PHISHING ATTACKS:
There are several types of phishing attacks, including:


SPEAR PHISHING: Targeted attacks against specific individuals or organizations.
WHALING: Targeted attacks against high-level executives or decision-makers.
SMISHING: Phishing attacks via SMS or text messages.
VISHING: Phishing attacks via voice calls.


WHY IS PHISHING EFFECTIVE?
Phishing attacks are often successful because they:


1. Exploit Human Psychology: Attackers use social engineering tactics to create a sense of urgency or fear.
2. Use Convincing Messages: Attackers create messages that appear legitimate and convincing.
3. Take Advantage of Lack of Awareness: Victims may not be aware of phishing tactics or how to identify them.


HOW TO IDENTIFY PHISHING ATTEMPTS:


Phishing attempts can be identified by looking out for certain red flags. Here are some common characteristics of phishing attempts:


1. URGENT OR THREATENING LANGUAGE
Be cautious of messages that create a sense of urgency or fear. Phishing attempts often
1. Threaten to cancel your account or subscription 
2. Claim that a promotion or offer will expire unless you take immediate action
3. Imply that your sensitive information has been compromised or is at risk
Use intimidating language to prompt you into taking action
Legitimate organizations rarely use threatening language or create artificial urgency. If you're unsure, it's best to verify the message through other channels.


2. SUSPICIOUS SENDER INFORMATION
1. Verify the sender's email address to ensure it is legitimate.
2. Look out for misspelled domain names or unusual email addresses.


3. GENERIC GREETINGS
Phishing attempts often use generic greetings such as "Dear customer" instead of addressing you by name.


4. POOR SPELLING AND GRAMMAR
Legitimate organizations typically have professional communications that are free of errors. Be wary of messages with:
1.  Multiple spelling mistakes
2.  Grammatical errors
3.  Inconsistent formatting
4.  Unprofessional tone
If a message contains numerous errors, it is actually a phishing attempt.




PREVENTION STRATEGIES AND BEST PRACTICES:

2. Verify website authenticity: Check the website's URL and ensure it's secure (https).
